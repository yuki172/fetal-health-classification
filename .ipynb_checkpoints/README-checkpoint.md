# Data Sources
This project uses the Fetal Health dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification.

As required by the data source, we cite the following article

Ayres de Campos et al. (2000) SisPorto 2.0 A Program for Automated Analysis of Cardiotocograms. J Matern Fetal Med 5:311-318

# Project Objectives
The dataset contains observation records of Cardiotocogram (CTG) exams which are used to assess fetal health. The health state of each record is assigned by obstetritians into one of three classes: normal, suspect and pathological. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between the CTG observation features with the health state and develop classification models that infer the latter from exam results.
